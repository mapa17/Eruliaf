#Scenario: Little PeerC1 Net
#Simulates a Torrent of 10MB (1000 pieces) to be downloaded by 5/10 normal BitTorrent peers and 5/10 modified peers.
#Starting out with 100 peers and one seeder.
#No further peers join the Torrent and peers leave after completing their download.
#The seeder has a high upload bandwidth and the peers vary between 64-256kb Up, 256-1024kb Down
#Which is equivalent to DirectUpload min 320 ticks, max 1280 ticks , DirectDownload min 80 ticks, max 320
#The Simulation runs for 1800 seconds (30 min)
