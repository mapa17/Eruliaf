#Scenario: Little Peer Net
#Simulates a Torrent of 10MB (1000 pieces) to be downloaded by BitTorrent only peers. Starting out with 30 peers and one seeder.
#New peers constantly join the network with a propability of 0.05 every round.
#Peers that have completed their download stay in the network as seeders with a probability of 0.8 every round.
#The seeder has a high upload bandwidth and the peers vary between 64-256kb Up, 256-1024kb Down
#Which is equivalent to DirectUpload min 320 ticks, max 1280 ticks , DirectDownload min 80 ticks, max 320
#The Simulation runs for 1800 seconds (30 min)
