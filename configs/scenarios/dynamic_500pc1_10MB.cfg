#Scenario: Little PeerC1 Net
#Simulates a Torrent of 10MB (1000 pieces) to be downloaded by MODIFIED BitTorrent only peers.
#New peers constantly join the network with a probability of 0.05 every round.
#Peers that have completed their download stay in the network as seeders with a probability of 0.995 every round.
#The seeder has a high upload bandwidth and the peers vary between 64-256kb Up, 256-1024kb Down
#Which is equivalent to DirectUpload min 320 ticks, max 1280 ticks , DirectDownload min 80 ticks, max 320
#The Simulation runs for 3000 seconds (50 min)
