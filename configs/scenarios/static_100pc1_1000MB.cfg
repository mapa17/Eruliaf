#Scenario: Little Peer Net
#Simulates a Torrent of 500MB (1000 pieces) to be downloaded by 0/10 normal BitTorrent peers and 10/10 modified peers.
#Starting out with 100 peers and one seeder.
#No further peers join the Torrent and peers leave after completing their download.
#The seeder has a high upload bandwidth and the peers vary between 1Mb-5Mb Up, 10Mb-50Mb Down
#Which is equivalent to Direct Upload max: 4096 ticks, min: 819 ticks,  and Direct Download max: 409 ticks, min: 81 ticks 
#The Simulation runs for 3000 seconds (50 min)
