#Scenario: Little Peer Net
#Simulates a Torrent of 1000MB (2000 pieces) to be from a mixture of Peer and PeerC1 nodes.
#New peers constantly join the network with a probability of 0.05 every round with ratio between origin an modified peers of 1/1 
#Peers that have completed their download stay in the network as seeders with a probability of 0.9 every round.
#The seeder has a high upload bandwidth and the peers vary between 64-256kb Up, 256-1024kb Down
#Which is equivalent to DirectUpload min 320 ticks, max 1280 ticks , DirectDownload min 80 ticks, max 320
#The Simulation runs for 1800 seconds (30 min)
